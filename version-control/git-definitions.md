# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
    - Version Control is a system that programmers use to track/make changes to code. It allows programmers to view the total history of the code and even gives programmers the ability to go back in time to certain save points of their code. Version Control is useful because it allows programmers access to the entire timeline of their code; allowing them to view every single change made. This is helpful in case a programmer needs to go back to a certain save point of their code and rework their code from any given save point.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
    - A branch is a copy of code that can be later merged with the original code. This is useful when working on projects because it allows you to write new lines of code or edit existing lines of code without "breaking" your application or website. After you've made the changes and made sure you are happy with your code, you can then merge your working branch with the master branch and just like that, your project has been updated with the work you did on the working branch.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
    - A commit is a save point that a programmer can create at anytime during a project. It is best practice to commit each new feature individually. When creating a commit, a programmer has to write a commit message. This message should clearly state what changes or updates have been added in a short, concise manner. 
* What is a merge conflict?
    - A merge conflict is when two different branches of a repo have made changes to the code that conflict with one another. When those branches are merged, the pull requests for each branch will show a merge conflict.
